## **Jaguar** is a project of general-purpose language, where the resources aims to:
1. #### Parallel programming;
2. #### Teory of graphs suport;
3. #### Expressive syntactic.
## Around this issue, we are looking for:
1. #### Otmizations;
2. #### Best machine codes;
3. #### Good practices of programming.
## Jaguar version is building by project members, because it's a institucional research project.
# ðŸ“ƒ Features
## The **main features** target of jaguar are:
- ### Multi-paradigm: functional, imperative, concurrent, parallel and distributed, process-oriented;
- ### Typing discipline: dynamic, duck, weak typing;
- ### Component oriented (by compiled library).

## Dependencies:
- ### Look for [Binary Mono](https://github.com/UFC-Jaguar/prototypes/tree/main/environment_install) environment to RUN MPI/CSharp software on Linux.
