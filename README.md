### This repository include a parallel version of **UFC-Lang** Project (programming language project). 
### The parallel version is named "Jaguar".
### **Jaguar** is a project of general-purpose language, where the resources aims to:
1. #### Parallel programming;
2. #### Teory of graphs support;
3. #### Expressive syntactic.
## Around this issue, we are looking for:
1. #### Otmizations;
2. #### Best machine codes;
3. #### Good practices of programming.
## Jaguar version is building by project members. It's a institucional research project, started in [ufc cadproj](https://cadproj.ufc.br/projects/592), but all people can contributed (become a member). For that, use the email informed in end of page.
